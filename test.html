</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">9</span> God said, "Let the waters under the sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear." It was so.

<span class="verse_no">3</span> God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it he rested from all his work which he had done in his creation.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">4</span> These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Yahweh God made the earth and the heavens.
<span class="verse_no">5</span> No bush of the field was yet in the earth, and no plant of the field had yet sprouted, for Yahweh God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to work the ground.
<span class="verse_no">6</span> But a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">7</span>  Yahweh God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living being.
<span class="verse_no">8</span> Yahweh God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">9</span> Out of the ground Yahweh God made every tree to grow that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. This included the tree of life that was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
<span class="verse_no">10</span> A river went out of Eden to water the garden. From there it divided and became four rivers.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">11</span> The name of the first is Pishon. It is the one which flows throughout the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.
<span class="verse_no">12</span> The gold of that land is good. There is also bdellium and the onyx stone there.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">13</span> The name of the second river is Gihon. This one flows throughout the whole land of Cush.
<span class="verse_no">14</span> The name of the third river is Tigris, which flows east of Asshur. The fourth river is the Euphrates.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">15</span> Yahweh God took the man and put him into the garden of Eden to work it and to maintain it.
<span class="verse_no">16</span> Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, "From every tree in the garden you may freely eat.
<span class="verse_no">17</span> But from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you may not eat, for on the day that you eat from it, you will surely die."

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">18</span> Then Yahweh God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone. I will make him a helper corresponding to him."
<span class="verse_no">19</span> Out of the ground Yahweh God formed every animal of the field and every bird of the sky. Then he brought them to the man to see what he would call them. Whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.
<span class="verse_no">20</span> The man gave names to all the cattle, to all the birds of the sky, and to every beast of the field. But for the man himself there was found no  helper corresponding to him.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">21</span> Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, so the man slept. Yahweh God  took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh where he took the rib.
<span class="verse_no">22</span> With the rib that Yahweh God had taken from the man, he made a woman and brought her to the man.
<span class="verse_no">23</span> The man said, "This time, this one is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She will be called 'woman', because she was taken out of man."

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">24</span> Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother, he will be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.
<span class="verse_no">25</span> They were both naked, the man and his wife, but were not ashamed.





</p><h5 class="section"></h5><span class="chapter_no">3</span><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">1</span> Now the serpent was more shrewd than any other beast of the field which Yahweh God had made. He said to the woman, "Has God really said, 'You must not eat from any tree of the garden?'"
<span class="verse_no">2</span> The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat the fruit from the trees of the garden,
<span class="verse_no">3</span> but concerning the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God said, 'You may not eat it, nor may you touch it, or you will die.'"

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">4</span> The  serpent said to the woman, "You will surely not die.
<span class="verse_no">5</span> For God knows that the day you eat it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
<span class="verse_no">6</span> And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took some of its fruit, and ate it. And she gave some also to her husband who was with her, and he ate it.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">7</span> The  eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.
<span class="verse_no">8</span> They heard the sound of Yahweh God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, so the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">9</span> Yahweh God called to the man and said to him, "Where are you?"
<span class="verse_no">10</span> The man said, "I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked. So I hid myself."
<span class="verse_no">11</span> God said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">12</span> The man said, "The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it."

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">14</span> Yahweh God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed are you alone among all the cattle and all the beasts of the field.

<span class="verse_no">15</span> I will put hostility between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed. He will bruise your head, and you will bruise his heel."

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">16</span> To the woman he said, "I will greatly multiply your pain in having children. Your desire will be for your husband, but he will rule over you."

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">17</span> To Adam he said, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree, concerning which I commanded you, saying, 'You may not eat from it,' cursed is the ground because of you. In painful toil you will eat from it all the days of your life.
<span class="verse_no">18</span> It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.
<span class="verse_no">19</span> By the sweat of your face you will eat bread, until you return to the ground. For out of it you were taken. For dust you are, and to dust you will return."

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">20</span> The man called his wife’s name Eve because she was the mother of all living things.
<span class="verse_no">21</span> Yahweh God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins and clothed them.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">22</span> Yahweh God said, "Now the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil. So now he must not be allowed to put forth his hand, take from the tree of life, eat it, and live forever."
<span class="verse_no">23</span> Therefore Yahweh God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to cultivate the ground from which he had been taken.
<span class="verse_no">24</span> So God drove the man out of the garden, and he placed cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden, and a flaming sword that turned every way, in order to guard the way to the tree of life.

<span class="verse_no">4</span> As for Abel, he brought some of the firstborn of his flock and some of the fat. Yahweh accepted Abel and his offering,
<span class="verse_no">5</span> but Cain and his offering he did not accept. So Cain was very angry, and his face looked dejected.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">6</span> Yahweh said to Cain, "Why are you angry and why is your face looking dejected?

<span class="verse_no">15</span> Yahweh said to him, "If anyone kills Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold." Then Yahweh put a mark on Cain, so that if anyone found  him, that person would not strike him.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">16</span> So Cain went out from the presence of Yahweh and lived in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

<span class="verse_no">17</span> But Yahweh said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do,
<span class="verse_no">18</span> since Abraham will indeed become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him?
<span class="verse_no">19</span> For I have chosen him, that he may instruct his children and his household after him, to keep the way of Yahweh, to do righteousness and justice, so that Yahweh may bring upon Abraham all that he has promised him."

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">20</span> Then Yahweh said, "Because the cries from Sodom and Gomorrah are so many, and because their sin is so very grave,

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">22</span> So the men turned from there, and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before Yahweh.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">29</span> He spoke to him yet again, and said, "What if there are forty found there?" He replied, "I will not do it for the forty’s sake."
<span class="verse_no">30</span> He said, "Please do not be angry, Lord, so I may speak. Perhaps thirty will be found there. He replied, "I will not do it, if I find thirty there."

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><span class="chapter_no">19</span><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">1</span> The two angels came to Sodom in the evening, while Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom. Lot saw them, arose to meet them, and bowed down with his face to the ground.
<span class="verse_no">2</span> He said, "Please my lords, I urge you to turn aside into your servant’s house, stay for the night, and wash your feet. Then you can rise up early and go on your way." And they said, "No, we will spend the night in the town square."
<span class="verse_no">3</span> But he urged them strongly, so they went with him, and entered into his house. He made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">4</span> But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, both young and old, all the men from every part of the city.

<span class="verse_no">8</span> Look, I have two daughters that have not had relations with any man. Let me, I beg you, bring them out to you, and do to them whatever is good in your eyes. Only do nothing to these men, because they have come under the shadow of my roof.

They pressed hard against the man, against Lot, and came near to break down the door.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">10</span> But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them and shut the door.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">12</span> Then the men said to Lot, "Do you have anyone else here? Any sons-in-law, your sons and your daughters, and whoever you have in the city, get them out of here,
<span class="verse_no">13</span> because we are about to destroy this place. The outcry against its people has become so loud before Yahweh that he has sent us to destroy it."

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">14</span> Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, the men who had promised to marry his daughters, and said, "Quick, get out of this place, for Yahweh is about to destroy the city." But to his sons-in-law he seemed to be joking.
<span class="verse_no">15</span> When the morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, "Get going, take your wife and your two daughters that are here, so you are not swept away in the punishment of the city."

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">16</span> But he lingered. So the men grabbed his hand, and the hand of his wife, and the hands of his two daughters, because Yahweh was merciful to him. They brought them out, and set them outside the city.
<span class="verse_no">17</span> When they had brought them out, one of the men said, "Flee for your lives! Do not look back, or stay anywhere on the plain. Escape to the mountains so you are not swept away."

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">18</span> Lot said to them, "Oh, please, no, my lords!
<span class="verse_no">19</span> Your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great lovingkindness in saving my life, but I cannot escape to the mountains, because the disaster will overtake me, and I will die.
<span class="verse_no">20</span> Look, that city over there is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Please, let me escape there (is it not a little one?), and my life will be saved."

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">21</span> He said to him, "Alright, I am granting this request also, that I will not destroy the city which you have mentioned.
<span class="verse_no">22</span> Hurry! Escape there, for I cannot do anything until you arrive there." Therefore the city was called Zoar.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">23</span> The sun had risen upon the earth when Lot reached Zoar.
<span class="verse_no">24</span> Then Yahweh rained down upon Sodom and Gomorrah sulphur and fire from Yahweh out of the sky.
<span class="verse_no">25</span> He destroyed those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and the plants that grew on the ground.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">26</span> But Lot's wife, who was behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.
<span class="verse_no">27</span> Abraham got up early in the morning and went to the place where he had stood before Yahweh.
<span class="verse_no">28</span> He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the plain. He looked and behold, smoke was arising from the land like the smoke of a furnace.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">29</span> So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, God did not forget Abraham. He sent Lot out of the midst of the destruction when he destroyed the cities in which Lot had lived.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">30</span> But Lot left Zoar and went up to live in the mountains with his two daughters, because he was afraid to live in Zoar. So he lived in a cave, he and his two daughters.

<span class="verse_no">33</span> So they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he did not know when she lay down, nor when she arose."

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">34</span> The next day the firstborn said to the younger, "Listen, I lay last night with my father.

<span class="verse_no">35</span> So they made their father drink wine that night also, and the younger arose, and lay with him. He did not know when she lay down, nor when she arose.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">36</span> So both the daughters of Lot were pregnant by their father.
<span class="verse_no">37</span> The firstborn gave birth to a son, and named him Moab. He became the ancestor of the Moabites of today.

<span class="verse_no">11</span> Abraham said, "Because I thought, 'Surely there is no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.'
<span class="verse_no">12</span> Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><span class="chapter_no">24</span><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">1</span> Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years, and Yahweh had blessed Abraham in all things.

<span class="verse_no">6</span> Abraham said to him, "Make sure that you do not take my son back there!
<span class="verse_no">7</span> Yahweh, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and from the land of my relatives, and who promised me with a solemn oath saying, 'To your offspring I will give this land,' he will send his angel before you, and you will get a wife for my son from there.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">10</span> The servant took ten of his master's camels and departed. He also took with him all kinds of gifts from his master. He departed and went to the region of Aram Naharaim, to the city of Nahor.

<span class="verse_no">14</span> Let it happen like this. When I say to a young woman, 'Please lower  your pitcher so that I may drink,' and she says to me, 'Drink, and I will water your camels too,' then let her be the one that you have appointed for your servant Isaac.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">15</span> It came about that even before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah came out with her water pitcher on her shoulder. Rebekah was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother.
<span class="verse_no">16</span> The young woman was very beautiful and a virgin. No man had had relations with her. She went down to the spring and filled her pitcher, and came up.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">17</span> Then the servant ran to meet her and said, "Please give me a little drink of water from your pitcher."
<span class="verse_no">18</span> She said, "Drink, my lord,"  and she quickly let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him a drink.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">21</span> The man watched her in silence to see whether Yahweh had prospered his journey or not.
<span class="verse_no">22</span> As the camels finished drinking, the man brought out a gold nose ring weighing half a shekel, and two gold bracelets for her arms weighing ten shekels,
<span class="verse_no">23</span> and asked, "Whose daughter are you? Tell me please, is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?"

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">24</span> She said to him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor."

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">26</span> Then the man bowed down and worshipped Yahweh.
<span class="verse_no">27</span> He said, "Blessed be Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his lovingkindness and his faithfulness toward my master. As for me, Yahweh has led me directly to the house of my master’s relatives."

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">28</span> Then the young woman ran and told her mother’s household about all of these things.
<span class="verse_no">29</span> Now Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. Laban ran to the man who was out at the road by the spring.
<span class="verse_no">30</span> When he had seen the nose ring and the bracelets on his sister’s arms, and when he had heard the words of Rebekah his sister, "This is what  the man said to me," he went to the man, and, behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">31</span> And Laben said, "Come, you blessed of Yahweh. Why are you standing outside? I have prepared the house, and a place for the camels."
<span class="verse_no">32</span> So the man came to the house and he unloaded the camels. The camels were given straw and feed, and water was provided to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">33</span> They set food before him to eat, but he said,  "I will not eat until I have said what I have to say." So Laban said, "Speak on."
<span class="verse_no">34</span> He said, "I am Abraham’s servant.
<span class="verse_no">35</span> Yahweh has blessed my master very much and he has become great. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male servants and female servants, and camels and donkeys.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">36</span> Sarah, my master’s wife, bore a son to my master when she was old, and he has given everything that he owns to him.

<span class="verse_no">38</span> Instead, you must go to my father’s family, and to my relatives, and get a wife for my son.'

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">39</span> I said to my master, 'Perhaps the woman will not follow me.'
<span class="verse_no">40</span> But he said to me, 'Yahweh, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you and he will prosper your way, so that you will get a wife for my son from among my relatives and from my father’s family line.
<span class="verse_no">41</span> But you will be free from my oath if you come to my relatives and they will not give her to you. Then you will be free from my oath.'

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">42</span> So I arrived today at the spring, and said, 'O Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, if you will truly prosper the path that I am taking,

<span class="verse_no">44</span> and who says to me, "Drink,  and I will also draw water for your camels," Let her be the woman whom Yahweh has chosen for my master’s son."'

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">45</span> Even before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her pitcher on her shoulder and she went down to the spring and drew water. So I said to her, 'Please give me  a drink.'
<span class="verse_no">46</span> She quickly lowered her pitcher from her shoulder and said, 'Drink, and I will give your camels water also.' So I drank, and she watered the camels also.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">47</span> I asked her and said, 'Whose daughter are you?' She said, 'The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.' Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms.
<span class="verse_no">48</span> Then I bowed down and worshipped Yahweh, and blessed Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me by the right way to find the daughter of my master’s relative for his son.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">49</span> Now therefore, if you are prepared  to treat my master with loyalty and faithfulness, tell me. But if not, tell me, so that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left."

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">50</span> Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, "The thing has come  from Yahweh; we cannot speak to you either bad or good.
<span class="verse_no">51</span> Look, Rebekah is before you. Take her and go, so she may be the wife of your master’s son, as Yahweh has spoken."

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">52</span> When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the ground to Yahweh.
<span class="verse_no">53</span> The servant brought out articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious gifts to her brother and to her mother.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">54</span> Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank. They stayed there overnight, and when they arose in the morning, he said, "Send me away to my master."
<span class="verse_no">55</span> Her brother and her mother said, "Let the young woman stay with us for a few more days, at least ten. After that she may go."

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">56</span> But he said to them, "Do not hinder me, since Yahweh has prospered my way. Send me on my way so that I may go to my master."
<span class="verse_no">57</span> They said, "We will call the young woman and ask her."
<span class="verse_no">58</span> So they called Rebekah and asked her, "Will you go with this man?" She replied, "I will go."

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">59</span> So they sent their sister Rebekah, along with her female attendant, on her journey with Abraham’s servant and his men.
<span class="verse_no">60</span> They blessed Rebekah, and said to her, "Our sister, may you be the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and may your descendants possess the gate of those who hate them."

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">61</span> Then Rebekah arose, and she and her servant girls mounted the camels, and followed the man. Thus the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
<span class="verse_no">62</span> Now Isaac was living in the Negev, and had just returned from Beer Lahai Roi.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">63</span> Isaac went out to meditate in the field in the evening. When he looked up and saw, behold, there were camels coming!
<span class="verse_no">64</span> Rebekah looked, and when she saw Isaac, she jumped down from the camel.
<span class="verse_no">65</span> She said to the servant, "Who is that man who is walking in the field to meet us?" The servant said, "It is my master." So she took her veil, and covered herself.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">66</span> The servant recounted to Isaac all the things that he had done.
<span class="verse_no">67</span> Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent and took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.

<span class="verse_no">32</span> Let me walk through all your flock to-day, removing from it every speckled and spotted sheep, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats. These  will be my wages.

<span class="verse_no">36</span> Laban also put three days’ journey between himself and Jacob. So Jacob kept tending the rest of Laban’s flocks.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">37</span> Jacob took fresh cut branches of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane-tree, and peeled white streaks in them, and made the white  inner wood appear that was in the sticks.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">39</span> The flocks conceived in front of the sticks, and the flocks brought forth ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted young.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">41</span> Whenever the stronger sheep in the flock were breeding, then Jacob laid the sticks in front of the eyes of the flock, in front of the watering troughs, so that they might conceive among the sticks.
<span class="verse_no">42</span> But when the feebler animals in the flock came, he did not  put the sticks before them. So the feebler animals were Laban’s, and the stronger were Jacob’s.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">17</span> Then Jacob arose and placed his sons and his wives upon the camels.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">33</span> Laban went into Jacob’s tent, into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two female servants, but he did not find  them.  He went out of Leah’s tent and entered into Rachel’s tent.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">34</span> Now Rachel had taken the household gods, put them in a camel’s saddle, and sat upon them. Laban searched the whole tent, but did not find them.
<span class="verse_no">35</span> She said to her father,"Do not be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up  before you, for I am having my period." So he searched but did not find his household gods.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">36</span> Jacob was angry and argued with Laban. He said to him, "What is my offense? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued after me?

<span class="verse_no">42</span> Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the one Isaac fears, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God has seen my  oppression and how hard I worked, and he rebuked you last night."

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">43</span> Laban answered and said to Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters, the grandchildren are my grandchildren, and the flocks are my flocks. All that you see is mine.  But what can I do today to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?
<span class="verse_no">44</span> So now, let us make a covenant, you and I, and let it be for a witness between you and me."

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">45</span> So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.

<span class="verse_no">7</span> Then Jacob was very afraid and  upset.  So he divided the people that were with him into two groups, and also the flocks, the herds, and the camels.
<span class="verse_no">8</span> He said, "If Esau comes to one camp and attacks it, then the camp which is left will escape."

<span class="verse_no">10</span> I am not worthy  of all your loving acts and of all the faithfulness that you have done for your servant.   For with only my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">13</span> Jacob stayed there that night. He took some of what  he had with him as a gift for Esau, his brother:

<span class="verse_no">15</span> thirty milking camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys  and ten male donkeys.
<span class="verse_no">16</span> These he handed over to his servants, every herd by itself. He said to his servants, "Go on ahead of me and put a space between each of the herds."

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">17</span> He instructed the first servant, saying, "When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, saying, 'To whom do you belong? Where do you come from? And whose are these animals before you ?'
<span class="verse_no">18</span> Then you will say, 'They are your servant Jacob’s. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau. And see, he is also coming after us.'"

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">19</span> Jacob also gave instructions to the second group,  the third, and all the men who followed the herds. He said, "You will say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.
<span class="verse_no">20</span> You will say also, 'Your servant Jacob is coming after us.' For he thought, "I will appease him with the gifts that go ahead of me.  When I meet him afterwards, perhaps he will accept me."
<span class="verse_no">21</span> So the gifts went on ahead of him. Hehimself stayed that night in the camp.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">22</span>  Jacob got up during the  night, and took his two wives, his two servants women, and his eleven children. He crossed the ford of the Jabbok with them.
<span class="verse_no">23</span> So  he took and sent them across the stream along with all his possessions.

</p><h5 class="section"></h5><p class="first_line_default left_margin_0"><span class="verse_no">24</span> Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled  with him until daybreak.

<span class="verse_no">32</span> That is why to this day the people of Israel  do not eat not the ligaments of the hip which are at the hip joint, because the man injured those ligaments while dislocating Jacob's  hip.

<span class="verse_no">11</span> Please accept my gift that was brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough." Thus Jacob urged him, and Esau accepted it.

<span class="verse_no">14</span> May my lord go ahead of his servant.  I will travel more slowly, at the pace of the cattle that are before me, and at the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir."

<span class="verse_no">16</span> So Esau that day started on his way back to Seir.
<span class="verse_no">17</span> Jacob traveled to Succoth, built himself a house, and made shelters for his livestock.  Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
